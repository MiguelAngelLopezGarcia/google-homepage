This is a fake google page made from me from the scratch. I am not trying to copy it it is just a challenge from The Odin's Proyect.

I started by writting all the html. First all the section that I thought it may have just by looking at the original page (it has toon more than I used). Being happy about my sections and divs I wrote the rest of the html. 

The page was looking good but no good enought so it was CSS time. Boy oh boy... CSS... It was difficult to made everything just as they have done, it took me 2 mornings to made it all the way to the end just because I wanted everything look like the original one (obiosly it's no the same, just very similar). 

I decided to made the page in Spanish just because I have my browser in this language, I am and live in Spain and it was easier for me to check that all the info was correct and with no gramatical errors. 

At the end I am very proud of how the things went on this proyect (even though I spend way more time than I wanted on CSS) just because of the resoult. 

I hope you liked it and if you have any suggestions just let me know! I am still learning how to be a web developer (at the moment I just know about html and CSS but step by step!) and I hope to become one soon!

Bye!
